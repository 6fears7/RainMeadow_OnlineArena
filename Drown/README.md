# Drown
This Mod will be released to the Steam workshop shortly after Rain Meadow releases. Check back soon!
## Overview

Play with or against one another in a race to open the Arena shelters. Attack creatures to earn points. Points buy revives, weapons, and ultimately... your escape. Disable spear hits to work together and pool your points. 

Creatures will flood you every 20 seconds. Will you control the battlefield just long enough to escape, or drown in its wake?

## Requirements
You must own Rain World on Steam, and have [Rain Meadow](https://github.com/henpemaz/Rain-Meadow) installed.

## Credits
May all the best parts of this mod go to the Lord Jesus Christ and all the worst parts be opened as a GitHub issue. Thanks to all the playtesters who have loved Arena and provided me invaluable feedback. You know who you are.
