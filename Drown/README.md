# Drown
This Mod will be released to the Steam workshop shortly after Rain Meadow releases. Check back soon!
## Overview

Play with or against one another in a race to open the Arena shelters. Land spears to earn points. Points buy revives, weapons, and ultimately... your escape. Disable spear hits to work together and pool your points. 

## Requirements
You must own Rain World on Steam, and have [Rain Meadow](https://github.com/henpemaz/Rain-Meadow) installed.

## Credits
May all the best parts of this mod go to the Lord Jesus Christ and all the worst parts be opened as a GitHub issue. Thanks to all the playtesters who have loved Arena and provided me invaluable feedback. You know who you are.
